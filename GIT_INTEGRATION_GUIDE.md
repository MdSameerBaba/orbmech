# 🚀 Git Integration Guide for Active Development

## Quick Setup

### 1. Initial Setup
```
"setup github"          # Configure GitHub credentials
"project mode"          # Switch to project mode
"create project MyApp"  # Create your project
"set project path to C:\path\to\your\code"  # Link to your VS Code project
```

### 2. Initialize Git
```
"git init"              # Initialize repository
"create github repo"    # Create GitHub repository
```

## 🔥 Quick Commands for Active Development

### Instant Save & Backup
```
"save"                  # Quick commit with auto message
"backup"                # Commit with "Backup progress" message
"quick save"            # Same as "save"
"commit fix bug"        # Custom commit message
```

### Push Changes
```
"push"                  # Auto-commit + push to GitHub
"save and push"         # Same as above
"commit and push"       # Same as above
```

### Check Status
```
"status"                # Check git status
"check status"          # Same as above
"git status"            # Detailed status with file list
```

### Sync with Remote
```
"sync"                  # Pull from remote, then push local changes
"git pull"              # Pull latest changes
```

### Advanced Git Operations
```
"git add ."             # Stage all files
"git add filename.py"   # Stage specific file
"git commit 'detailed message'"  # Commit with specific message
```

## 🎯 Workflow Examples

### While Coding in VS Code:
1. **Make changes in VS Code**
2. **Voice/Text command**: `"save"`
3. **Continue coding**
4. **When ready**: `"push"`

### End of Day Backup:
```
"backup"                # Commits with backup message
"push"                  # Pushes to GitHub
```

### Collaborative Development:
```
"sync"                  # Pull latest + push your changes
```

## 🔧 Project Management Commands

### Switch Projects
```
"switch to project MyApp"     # Switch by name
"select project 2"           # Switch by ID
"show projects"              # List all projects
```

### Project Info
```
"dashboard"             # Show project progress
"project status"        # Current project info
```

## ⚡ Natural Language Support

The system understands natural language:
- `"I want to save my work"` → Commits changes
- `"Push my latest changes"` → Commits and pushes
- `"What's my git status?"` → Shows repository status
- `"Backup my progress"` → Commits with backup message

## 🛠️ Error Handling

- **No project selected**: Automatically prompts to switch projects
- **No Git repo**: Guides through `git init` process
- **No GitHub repo**: Helps create repository
- **Uncommitted changes**: Warns before mode switching

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Stay in Project Mode**: Once in project mode, all Git commands work seamlessly
2. **Quick Voice Commands**: Use voice for instant saves while coding
3. **Auto-Commit on Push**: Push command automatically commits if needed
4. **Path Linking**: Link your VS Code project folder for automatic Git detection
5. **Background Monitoring**: System tracks uncommitted changes automatically

## 🔄 Integration with VS Code

1. **Code in VS Code** → Make your changes
2. **Voice Command** → `"save"` (commits instantly)
3. **Continue Coding** → No interruption
4. **End Session** → `"push"` (backs up to GitHub)

This creates a seamless workflow where Git operations happen in the background while you focus on coding!
