Sunny! Here's a beautiful poem from William Shakespeare's iconic play, Hamlet:

"To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause."

— Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 1)

This soliloquy is one of the most famous and resonant passages in all of Shakespeare's works, exploring the human condition and the existential crisis that Hamlet is grappling with. The poem (or speech) is a profound meditation on the meaning of life, the nature of mortality, and the human desire for peace and resolution.

Would you like me to analyze the poem further or provide a summary of the context in which it appears in the play?
