I reach out for you, but you're gone

The moments we shared, through all the years
But like the wind, you vanished in the night

I reach out for you, but you're gone
Leaving me with just this lonely song

And our love will shine, like a beacon's refrain
Until then, I'll hold on to the pain
And the love we shared, will remain

Whispers of our love, a fading light
I reach out for you, but you're gone
Leaving me with just this lonely song
