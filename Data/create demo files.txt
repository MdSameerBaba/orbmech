Hello Sunny,

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of creating demo files for various software, applications, or websites. A demo file is a sample file that showcases the features and functionality of a product. It serves as a proof-of-concept or a teaser to demonstrate the capabilities of a software or application to potential customers, investors, or stakeholders.

**Types of Demo Files:**

There are several types of demo files, including:

1. **Sample Data Files**: These are files that contain sample data, such as text documents, spreadsheets, or databases.
2. **Simulation Files**: These are files that simulate real-world scenarios or workflows, such as a simulation of a customer interaction or a workflow process.
3. **Scenario-Based Files**: These are files that demonstrate specific scenarios or use cases, such as a demo of a software feature or a workflow process.
