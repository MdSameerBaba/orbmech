Sunny, I've crafted a poem for you that captures the essence of your request:

Life's fleeting moments swiftly pass,
When joy is absent, time's vast.
The hours tick by, a slow decay,
As we trudge through days without a sway.

The fire that once burned bright and bold,
Dimmed by routine, grows cold.
The laughter's silenced, the heart's turned gray,
As life's beauty slips away.

We're lost in the haze of monotony,
A path we tread, without glee.
The days blend together, a blur of gray,
As we forget to seize the day.

Oh, how the years go by, so fast,
When we're not living life to the last.
The memories we make, a distant haze,
As we let life drift, without a gaze.

So let us cherish every waking hour,
For time's relentless march, we can't devour.
Let us find joy, in every single day,
And never let life slip away.

Sunny, I hope you find solace in these words. Remember, life is precious, and it's essential to make the most of every moment.
