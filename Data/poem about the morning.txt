Here's a poem about the morning, tailored to your request:

"As morning's golden light creeps over the floor,
The world awakens, refreshed once more.
The stars, now hidden, fade from view,
As sunrise paints the sky, anew.

The world, once still, begins to stir,
As morning's warmth awakens every bird.
Their sweet melodies, a gentle hush,
Echo through the dawn's soft rush.

The morning's quiet, peaceful reign,
As dew-kissed grass and flowers regain
Their vibrant hues, their scent so bright,
As morning's beauty takes its morning light.

The world, now refreshed, begins anew,
As morning's promise is revealed to you.
So rise, dear heart, and greet the day,
And let the morning's beauty chase the night away."
