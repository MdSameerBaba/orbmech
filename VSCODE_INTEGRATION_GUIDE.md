# 🚀 Enhanced Project Mode - VS Code Integration Guide

## 🎯 **Your Vision Realized**

NEXUS Project Mode now works as your **VS Code development companion**! It intelligently detects your open projects, provides contextual Git commands, and seamlessly switches between projects without needing specific project names in Git commands.

---

## 🔄 **Core Features**

### **1. Intelligent Project Detection**
NEXUS automatically detects projects open in VS Code:
```
detect projects
find projects
```
**Output:** Lists all currently open VS Code projects

### **2. Smart Project Switching**
Switch context without leaving VS Code:
```
switch to TestRepo
switch to MyNewApp  
set project TestApp
```
**Effect:** All subsequent Git commands execute in that project's directory

### **3. Contextual Git Commands**
Git commands automatically target your active project:

#### **Basic Git Operations**
```
git status          → Shows status for current project
git add .           → Stages changes in current project
commit "fix bugs"   → Quick commit with message
push               → Push current project to remote
pull               → Pull latest changes for current project
```

#### **Branch Management**
```
git branch                    → List branches in current project
git checkout -b feature-auth  → Create new branch in current project
git checkout main            → Switch to main branch
```

#### **Advanced Git Operations**
```
git log --oneline            → View commit history
git diff                     → See changes in current project
git stash                    → Stash changes temporarily
git merge feature-branch     → Merge branches
```

## 🧠 **Smart Context Management**

### **Project Status Overview**
```
current project
project status
```

**When NO project is active:**
```
🔍 Project Detection

📝 Open in VS Code:
1. ProjectAgent.py - orbmech

💡 Say 'switch to [project_name]' to set active project
```

**When project IS active:**
```
🎯 Active Project: TestRepo

📁 Path: C:\Users\mdsam\Desktop\TestRepo
📅 Created: 2025-09-10 22:24:57
⏰ Deadline: 2025-12-31
📊 Progress: 0%
🔧 Type: software_development

🔄 Git Status: ✅ Initialized
🌐 GitHub: Not connected

💡 Quick Actions:
• git status - Check changes
• commit changes - Quick commit
• project progress - Update progress
• switch to [other_project] - Change project
```

---

## 💡 **Intelligent Command Processing**

### **How It Works:**
1. **Project Detection**: NEXUS scans VS Code processes to find open projects
2. **Context Switching**: When you switch projects, all paths and Git operations target that project
3. **Command Translation**: Simple commands like `git status` become `git status` executed in `/path/to/current/project`
4. **Path Management**: No need to specify project paths - NEXUS handles it automatically

### **Example Workflow:**
```
You: "detect projects"
NEXUS: Shows: orbmech, TestRepo, MyWebApp

You: "switch to TestRepo"  
NEXUS: ✅ Switched to project: TestRepo

You: "git status"
NEXUS: Executes in C:\Users\mdsam\Desktop\TestRepo
       Shows status for TestRepo specifically

You: "commit fix authentication bug"
NEXUS: Commits changes in TestRepo with that message

You: "switch to MyWebApp"
NEXUS: ✅ Switched to project: MyWebApp

You: "git status"  
NEXUS: Now executes in MyWebApp directory
       Shows status for MyWebApp specifically
```

## 🎯 **Perfect for Your Workflow**

### **VS Code Integration Benefits:**
✅ **No Path Confusion**: Git commands always target the right project  
✅ **Quick Context Switching**: Change projects with simple voice commands  
✅ **Automatic Detection**: Finds projects you're already working on  
✅ **Seamless Debugging**: Use NEXUS while coding without interruption  
✅ **Voice-Friendly**: Say commands naturally while typing  

### **Development Workflow:**
```
1. Open multiple projects in VS Code
2. "Hey NEXUS, detect projects" → See all open projects
3. "Switch to MyMainProject" → Set context
4. Code in VS Code...
5. "Git status" → Check changes via NEXUS
6. "Commit implemented user auth" → Quick commit
7. "Switch to MySecondProject" → Change context
8. Continue coding...
```

## 🚀 **Test Your New Features**

### **Quick Test Sequence:**
1. Open multiple projects in VS Code
2. In NEXUS: `mode project`
3. Say: `detect projects`
4. Say: `switch to [your_project_name]`
5. Say: `git status`
6. Say: `current project`

**Everything should work contextually without specifying paths!** 🎉

## 💬 **Natural Language Commands**

You can use natural language:
- "Switch to my main project" → Finds closest match
- "What's the git status?" → Runs git status on active project
- "Commit the bug fixes" → Commits with "bug fixes" message
- "Show me the current project" → Displays project info
